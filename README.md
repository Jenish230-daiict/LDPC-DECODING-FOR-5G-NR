# LDPC-DECODING-FOR-5G-NR
• Implemented LDPC encoder and decoder in MATLAB using Base Graph 1&amp;2 with a fixed lifting size of z = 52.
• Developed soft-decision decoding using the Min-Sum Algorithm and compared results with hard-decision decoding and theoretical limits.
• Simulated transmission over an AWGN channel using BPSK modulation; evaluated performance using BER vs. SNR plots.
• Structured modular code to support multiple code rates and ensure flexibility for future simulations and extensions.
